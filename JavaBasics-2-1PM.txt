Creating first program in java
- Every java program start with class
- Class name should start with Capital Letter
- Class name should be same as file name
- Class name starts with either alphabet or special symbol(_ or $)


1. Compile the java code
	- javac filename.java

2. Run / Execute the java code
	- java bytecodename or classname


javac (.java)--> compile --> byte code (.class) --> interpret or java or JRE --> Machine code (.obj)

Main() Method:

- main is a entry point of every java program
- without main java will compile the code and convert it into byte code, but it can't execute the 
	code or interpret the code

4 types of scopes in java
public: global, which is accessible for all from any where
private: accessible within the class only
protected: can be accessed inside the package/folder, can also be accessed outside the 
package by using inheritance
default: It is not a reserved keyword, if you will not specify any scope then it is default. The scope can 
be accessed by any class but within same package.

Why main is public?
- JRE uses main: java bytecode
- java command trigger the JRE
- JRE load your class in the memory
- JRE is looking for main
- JRE is outside from your directory/package/folder
- And outside the package things can access

Why main is Static?
- static things can loaded into memory when class is loaded

Why main is void?
- main is void in nature
- main is entry point so there is no need to return anything

Main arguments String args[]:
- main has command line arguments
for e.g: copy xyz.txt abc.txt
- copy is a command and xyz.txt  & abc.txt are arguments

- We can pass any number of arguments that's why it is an Array type
- All arguments are pass to main in form of array of String

What is String?
- String is a Collection of class
- String internally is char[]
- String is a predefined class in a java as it is in capital letter
