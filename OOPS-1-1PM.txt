2 major types of programming

1. Procedural Programming: Functions- Divide a problem into functions
	e.g: C language
2. Object Oriented Programming: Wrap all the variables and functions into a 
	single unit
	e.g: C++, Java, C# etc

class A
{
int a, b;// data members
add() // member methods
{}
sub()
{}
div()
{}
mul()
{}
}

class B
{
sin()
{
  double a;
}
}


is java has global variable?
- No, because in java every program start with class and class doesn't have global
	variable.


C- We think only for functions
We never think of data, so either data/variable are define local or global.
And Global can be conflict with others.

C++: OOPS - provide a feature of data binding using classes.
So your class have your variable and your methods that never conflict with other 
developers.
So we can use for large and complex system and it fit for real world scenerios.

Now in OOPs we can use same variable names, same method name in different classes.

What is OOPS?

- Divide a problem into classes.
- OOPs Features
1. Class, Object
object - real world entity
e.g: A/C, Car, Projector etc
e.g: Ram, Shyam, Garima

Class- Collection of similar objects
Blueprint, Layout, Skeleton
Class - Collection of Features/Characterics
e.g: Human(Features Brain, Height, 2 Ears)
Object: Ram state brain sharp, 6 feet Height
Object - Object Contains State(Object Values)

Class - Human, Student, Employee
