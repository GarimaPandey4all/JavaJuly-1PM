Constructor

Q1. Need to initialize the member variable when object  is construct.
- We need constructor for this.

Constructor is call when you create an object.
So constructor will initialize the member variables
Constructor name is same as class name
Constructor never return anything
It is called only once
One class can have multiple constructors, so this thing is called constructor 
overloading.
Every Class by default have default constructor
So if you create any other constructor the default one is killed 

-When we need multiple constructor calls in a single call.
We need constructor chaining for this.
this keyword also use for constructor chaining.
