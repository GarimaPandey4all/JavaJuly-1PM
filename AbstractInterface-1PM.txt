Upcasting:
- child object is typecasted into a parent class object.

Downcasting:
- parent object is typecasted into a child class object.

Abstract
- Abstract Methods are methods can only be declared, not defined.
- Abstract class can have abstract methods
- You cannot create objects of abstract class

Interface:

- An Interface can have methods and variables, but the methods declared in an interface are by default abstract
(Only method signature, no body).

- Why do we use interface?
- It is used to achieve total abstraction
- Since Java does not support multiple inheritance in case of class, but by using interface it can achieve 
multiple inheritance/interface.

- Interfaces are used to implement abstraction.
So the question arises why we use interfaces when we have abstract classes?

The reason is abstract classes may contain non-final variables, whereas variables in interface are 
final, public , static.
